jscalc
======

A cross-platform mobile calculator with the logic in JavaScript and native UI on iOS and Android.

This is a proof of concept applciation for JSConf EU 2012, and Steamclock's future work on embedding JavaScript into native apps.


Building For iOS
================

Open iOS/JSCalc.xcodeproj in XCode 5. It should run on any ios 7 device.


Building For Android
====================

Opening the android project in intelliJ/Android Studio for the first time is a bit tricky.
These steps work for me (besides one ignorable error):
* Open Android Studio
* Select "Open Project"
* Choose android/build.gradle
* Check 'auto-import' and 'gradle wrapper'
* Click ok, and wait a minute

After that you can just select it from the 'recent projects' list.
